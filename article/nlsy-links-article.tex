\hypertarget{structural-and-topical-information}{%
\subsubsection{Structural and Topical
information}\label{structural-and-topical-information}}

The NlsyLinks package offers two types of datasets: topical and
structural. \emph{Topical datasets} contain predictor and outcome
variables typically used to test a focused hypotheses. For instance, the
NLSY79 Gen2 variables Rqqq.qq and Rqqq.qq are critical when studying the
relationship between conduct disorder and menarche (\emph{e.g.}, Rodgers
et al,
\href{http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10519-014-9676-4}{2015}),
but are not relevant to many hypotheses outside these fields.

In contrast, variables in \emph{structural datasets} are not typically
directly stated in the hypotheses, yet are essential to many
NLSY-related investigations including:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  familial relationships (\emph{e.g.}, Subjects 301 and 302 are
  half-brothers; Subjects 301 and 403 are first-cousins),
\item
  subject characteristics (\emph{e.g.}, Subject 301 is a Native American
  female; Subject 607 died from heart disease in 2005; Subject 802 is
  part of the military over-sample), and
\item
  subject-survey characteristics (\emph{e.g.}, Subject 301 was 15 years
  old for the 1981 Survey; Subject 301 did not respond to the 1990
  survey; Subject 702 completed the NLSY-C survey in 1996 and the
  NLSY-YA survey in 1998).
\end{itemize}

The NlsyLinks includes small topical datasets which allows the vignettes
and examples to be reproducible and more realistic. The structural
datasets are intended to be the authoritative representations, and are
the product of two NIH grants (for a complete history of the familial
relationships, see Rodgers et al.,
\href{http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007\%2Fs10519-016-9785-3}{2016}).

\hypertarget{terminology}{%
\subsubsection{Terminology}\label{terminology}}

The package pertains to multiple generations of the `Nlsy79' and
multiple generations of the `Nlsy97'. Because the NlsyLinks package
structures information within and between generations of the NLSY
simultaneously, it requires slightly unconventional NLSY terminology to
reduce ambiguity.

The `Nlsy79 sample' refers to both the original 12,686 subjects
interviewed in 1979, and their 11,500+ children (termed `Nlsy79 Gen1'
and `Nlsy79 Gen2', respectively). Data for the `Nlsy79 Gen1' comes from
the \href{http://www.bls.gov/nls/nlsy79.htm}{original NLSY79 study},
while data for the `Nlsy Gen2' comes from both the \href{}{NLSY-C study}
and the \href{}{NLSY-YA study} (`C' stands for children, and `YA' stands
for young adult). More specifically, the
\href{http://www.bls.gov/nls/nlsy79ch.htm}{Gen2 subjects} are the
biological offspring of the Gen1 mothers; they initially completed the
NLSY-C survey until roughly age 14, and then completed the NLSY-YA
survey (the oldest `Young Adult' respondent was QQ in the 2016 survey).
Although the NLSY does not interview `Nlsy79 Gen0' (the parents of Gen1)
or `Nlsy79 Gen3' (the children of Gen2), it does contain direct and
indirect information about them.

The terminology for the `Nlsy97' sample is similar yet simpler than the
`Nlsy79', because the explicit respondents come from a single generation
(\emph{i.e.}, the `Nlsy97 Gen1'). A few variables reflect Gen0 and Gen2.
In contrast to the Nlsy79, the Nlsy97 contains more information about
the housemates.

They both are nationally-representative samples.

Common NLSY79 terminology refers second generation subjects as
`children' when they are younger than age 15 (NLSYC), and as `young
adults' when they are 15 and older (NLSY79-YA); though they are the same
respondents, different funding mechanisms and different survey items
necessitate the distinction. This cohort is sometimes abbreviated as
`NLSY79-C', `NLSY79C', `NLSY-C' or `NLSYC'. This packages uses `Gen2' to
refer to subjects of this generation, regardless of their age at the
time of the survey.

\emph{Ambiguous Categories}: In some cases, the kinship of relatives can
be safely narrowed to two categories, but not one. The most common
scenario involves the \emph{ambiguous siblings} (among Nlsy Gen2
siblings); due to the sampling design, we know that the two participants
share the same mother, so they are either full siblings (\emph{R}=.50)
or half siblings (\emph{R}=.25). For the qqq\% that we could not
satisfactorily classify, we categorize them as ``ambiguous siblings''
and assign them \emph{R}=.375. Another common scenario involves the
\emph{ambiguous twins} (among Nlsy97 and both generations of Nlsy79).
For qqq\% of the twins we comfortably classify their relationship as
either MZ or DZ; the remaining qqq\% percent are classified as
``ambiguous twins'' and assigned \emph{R}=0.75. Empirically, this
approach has been successful in the previous 20 years of our previous
research, and is discussed further in (Rodgers, qqq).

\hypertarget{retrieving-data-with-the-nls-investigator}{%
\subsection{Retrieving Data with the NLS
Investigator}\label{retrieving-data-with-the-nls-investigator}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  This will use much of the existing
  \href{https://nlsy-links.github.io/NlsyLinks/docs/articles/nls-investigator.html}{NLS
  Investigator} vignette.
\end{itemize}

When a researcher pursues a new idea, we suggest to start by exploring
what the NLSY can offer by poking around the (a) vast online
documentation and (b) NLS Investigator. The documentation online
(www.qqq), and has general information (\emph{e.g.}, how to connect the
nationally representative sample was collected), topical information
(\emph{e.g.}, what medical and health information has been collected
across survey waves and subject ages), and descriptive summaries
(\emph{e.g.}, attrition over time for different race and ethnic groups).
This material has helpful suggestions which variables are available and
appropriate.

With these hints, it's time to identify and download the specific
variables from the NLS Investigator. The NLS Investigator is described
briefly here (see the
\href{https://github.com/nlsy-links/NlsyLinks/blob/master/inst/doc/NlsInvestigator.pdf}{NLS
Investigator} vignette for more detailed instruction). Researchers new
to the NLSY should expect at least a dozen round trips as they
iteratively improve and complete their set of variables. First, select
the `Study', such as `NLSY79 Child \& Young Adult' (which corresponds to
`Nlsy79 Gen2' in our terminology. Second, select your desired variables,
out of the tens of thousands available ones.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  When the analysis grows beyond a single outcome at one time point,
  researchers are better off using the modeling software itself
  (\emph{e.g.}, OpenMx, lavaan, Mplus) than then wrappers provided by
  \texttt{NlsyLinks}, or any other package.

  more efficient.
