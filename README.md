NlsyLinksStaging
================

After attending Hadley Wickam's workshop on package development in December (http://www.rstudio.com/training/curriculum/package-development.html), I decided that approach was the most desirable for NlsyLinks.  It should help the package more easy to maintain in the future, and easier for others to contribute towards (even within our own research team).  During this restructuring, the code will be on a GitHub repository: https://github.com/wibeasley/NlsyLinksStaging.

The effects of restructuring is intended to be only behind the scenes.  The way R users call the code should not change at all.  Furthermore, we'll continue to push development versions to R-Forge (https://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/nlsylinks/), like we have been for the past year.  Of course release version will continue to be updated on CRAN (http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/NlsyLinks/)
