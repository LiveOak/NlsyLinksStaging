NlsyLinks
================
This repository contains the code used in the [NlsyLinks](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/NlsyLinks/) R package.  For additional information about the package and using it in NLSY research, please see http://liveoak.github.io/NlsyLinks/

*Some background of the GitHub site:*
After attending Hadley Wickam's workshop on package development in December 2012 (http://www.rstudio.com/training/curriculum/package-development.html), I decided that approach was the most desirable for NlsyLinks.  It should help the package be more easily maintained in the future, and easier for others to contribute towards it (even within our own research team).  

We now use  [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/LiveOak/NlsyLinksStaging) as our primary way of managing and tracking versions of the source code.  We continue to use the [R-Forge site](https://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/nlsylinks/) to make sure the most recent version builds on the different OS platforms, and passes the associated checks.  The stable releases (intended for most researchers) is available on the package's  [CRAN site](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/NlsyLinks/).

The contents of the `/NlsyLinks/` directory is maintained on the [R-Forge site](https://r-forge.r-project.org/projects/nlsylinks/).  The other folders exist only in this GitHub repository.
