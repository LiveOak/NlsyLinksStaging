title: "Kinship links for the NLSY"
---

### Welcome

Welcome to the Kinship files for the NLSY. This site is structured into primary categories, each with nested subcategories.  Please navigate this site with the dropdown boxes at the top of the page.

 * **Research** provides context for the kinship links and how they can enhance NLSY research.
 * **Datasets** contains kinship links, as well as other datasets that may be helpful to NLSY researchers.
 * **About** covers the collaborators and stakeholders involved in the 20+ year history.

NlsyLinks is a free downloadable R package to facilitate Behavior Genetic and Family Studies research using the NLSY samples (the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth).  These samples are based on a cross-generational longitudinal nationally representative sample of over 30,000 participants followed for up to 35 years.  There are almost 50,000 pairwise kinship links.

Researchers and grad students interested using the [NLSY](http://www.bls.gov/nls/) for Behavior Genetics and family research, please start with our 2016 article, [*The NLSY Kinship Links: Using the NLSY79 and NLSY-Children Data to Conduct Genetically-Informed and Family-Oriented Research*](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10519-016-9785-3).

Repositories produced by our research include:
* the [NlsyLinks](https://github.com/LiveOak/NlsyLinks) package.
* the [determination of the links from our 2017 grant](https://github.com/LiveOak/nlsy-links-determination-2017).
* the [determination of the links from our 2011 grant](https://github.com/LiveOak/nlsy-links-determination-2011).
* [Lifespan research using Behavioral Genetics and the NLSY](https://github.com/OuhscBbmc/nlsy-bg-lifespan-1).
